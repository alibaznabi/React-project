        <h4>BUILDING THE FOUNDATION</h4>
        <p>Here we go! Everything starts from choosing in favour of quality in regards to every step we will undertake in our mission. Our engagement in providing a different experience with NOTORIOUS KINGS NFT will be easily identified within the collectibles high impacting quality. The community we aim to build around this project is composed by art fans with a pretentious eye for something spectacular. In building our community, meritocracy will be the keyword and there will be over 3000 whitelist spots and incentives of a total value of 5 ETH to reward consistent efforts.</p>

        <h4>VICTORY LOVES PREPARATION</h4>
        <p>December 2021 - April 2022
            Charged, we move on and conduct a quality informative campaign with the ultimate scope of bringing answers to all relevant questions. All the t’s will be crossed and all I’s will be dotted so the art, the minting, and all other aspects will be finalised. Also we have prepared 100 NOTORIOUS KINGS NFT items plus other incentives to indulge our community with before the moment that all predators feared most…</p>
            <div className='roadmapMid'></div>
        <h4>THE LAUNCH</h4>
        <p>ROARR! The kings are back. Time for action. Each art piece will find its owner in a desirable smooth minting process.Once completed, we secured 6 ETH in prizes (1 each for 6 NK owners to be raffled)</p>
        <div className='roadmapMid'></div>
        <h4>THE AFTER PARTY</h4>
        <p>To reward all parties involved and to celebrate the 100% distribution of NOTORIOUS KINGS NFT we have planned attractive incentives. An additional 100 giveaway NK NFT’s will be raffled, an amazing experience at a Luxurious Safari Resort plus a substantial contribution to the lionrecoveryfund.org (or other) are ways in which we want to express our SOLD OUT celebration.</p>
        <div className='roadmapMid'></div>
        <h4>THE GAME</h4>
        <p>Late summer 2022 will bring an important asset to the community and not only. With sneak peeks in the meantime, we want to bring a smart play to earn games to provide great gaming experience to the end users. One of the main creators is a chess player with 2300+ Elo. We’re confident that the game will prevail. NOTORIOUS KINGS NFT holders will have utility in the game.</p>

        <h4>THE RIDE</h4>
        <p>The end of year should sound like more celebration. That’s why, we are aiming to offer a Sports Car (TBA) to 1 NOTORIOUS KING during the gifts season!</p>
